# BestBeaches
Best Beaches version 1.0
This program allows a user to input an address and it will return the best beaches in the area to go to based on the wind, temperature, and water temperature at that beach.
In the next version there will be an updated algorithm that uses more data points like UV index and wind direction utilizing a Machine Learning model.

Hoping to have the next version released by June 15.
